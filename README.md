Operation Neko International.

## Developmental Goals

### Version 1.0.0

#### Overview

Content will be generated internally only, and will not include commentary from
external users. We'll look to have the ability to integrate content dynamically
into our articles (described in more detail bellow). There will be two
'templates' for content, 1) a home page with aggregated content, and 2) content
pages, which houses the dynamically-engaged content.

Content will be added to the page via a YAML / plain-text file loaded into the
appropriate content-specific directory. Once added, this content will
automatically be added to the site given a unique URL tag.

e.g.

```
http://www.neko-daddies.net/modern_gaming
```
